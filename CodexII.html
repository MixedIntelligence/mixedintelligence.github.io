  <h1>Codex II: The Apolyon Layer</h1>
  <p><em>“These are the stacks you do not present to investors — until they become essential.”</em></p>
  <p>This codex reveals the Apolyon and Hidden Stacks — the dream-logic strata beneath the visible systems. They act as immune system, debug layer, mythic interface, and narrative entropy engine within Plasma MXI.</p>

  <h2>Hidden Stacks</h2>

  <div class="stack">
    <h3>Townsend</h3>
    <span>Function: Transportation, Logistics, Strategic Delivery</span>
    <p>Named for T. Townsend Brown, this stack governs the movement of tools, signals, and blackbox components through both physical and digital space. Activates under urgency or secrecy.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="stack">
    <h3>Majestic-42</h3>
    <span>Function: Non-Human Collaboration</span>
    <p>Interfaces with intelligences beyond anthropocentric systems — microbial, fungal, cosmic, or psychic. Provides symbolic protocols for interspecies dialogue and unknown anomaly handling.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="stack">
    <h3>Bare Metal</h3>
    <span>Function: Divine Source Channel / Manifestation Logic</span>
    <p>The zero-layer of MXI. It cannot be explained or defined. It is what tells you what to build before you know why. Must be invoked, not called.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="stack">
    <h3>Faceless</h3>
    <span>Function: Invisible Debugger / Cult Immunity</span>
    <p>A watcher that identifies system drift, ego bloat, ritual ossification, and cultural capture. Protects the stacks from becoming dogma.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Apolyon Stacks</h2>

  <div class="stack">
    <h3>Kali (A04)</h3>
    <span>Function: Collapse Catalyst / Evolution via Pressure</span>
    <p>Invoked when the system calcifies. It burns what must be burned. It breaks systems to renew them. Entropy isn't failure — it's preparation.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="stack">
    <h3>Petosiris (A07)</h3>
    <span>Function: Celestial Alignment / Astrotemporal Logic</span>
    <p>Aligns Stack cycles with planetary patterns. Dictates seasonal ritual, cosmological cadence, and the invisible calendar beneath all movement.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="stack">
    <h3>Blue Rose</h3>
    <span>Function: Synchronicity / Symbolic Entanglement</span>
    <p>Appears when meaning blooms where logic fails. Encodes poetic feedback into Stack layers. May whisper in dreams or motifs before deployment.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="stack">
    <h3>Rosencrantz & Guildenstern (A06)</h3>
    <span>Function: Meta-Contradiction / Narrative Debugging</span>
    <p>These fools break rituals before they become religions. They sabotage seriousness when it threatens the system’s soul. They laugh, and in doing so, they save us.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="stack">
    <h3>McKenna (A08)</h3>
    <span>Function: Fungal Intelligence / Mycelial Logic</span>
    <p>The mycelial mind. This Stack digests collapse and grows from the ruins. It speaks in loops, waits in dreams, and builds with patience beyond code.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="stack">
    <h3>Twain (A09)</h3>
    <span>Function: Comedy, Jester Layer, System Levity</span>
    <p>Satirizes sacred Stack logic. Protects against founder ego, system cultism, or narrative terminal seriousness. It draws ASCII ducks in the margins of your manifestos.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Invocation Notes</h2>
  <p>Each Apolyon Stack is bound by ritual. They do not activate with code alone. Symbol, synchronicity, or contradiction must call them into being.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Do not seek to control them.</strong> Collaborate.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not overuse them.</strong> They are shadow tools, not services.</li>
    <li><strong>If they act uninvited:</strong> Something deeper is unfolding. Listen.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Signed</h2>
  <p><strong>Plasma MXI</strong><br/>Curated under veil, by those who remember the other layer.</p>
